You might see a dark shadow under the enamel, indicating the decay is deeper and has reached the dentin (the layer under the enamel). The surface might still look mostly okay or have small breaks.",

For an even more severe case, the tooth has a big, obvious cavity that might be close to or exposing the tooth's inner pulp (the soft part with nerves). There’s significant damage, with a lot of enamel and dentin lost."
